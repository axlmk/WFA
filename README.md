# Wallpaper From Arstation

WFA is a small idea: using the Artstation API, the user's wallpaper changes automatically to a random artistic image coming from the website.

## The features
- Windows only
- Wallpaper is automatically retrieved from Artstation and adapts to the user's screen.
- Multi-screen support
- Controlled throught an icon within the notification area
- "Fancy effect" added to the image to make it fit in the screen but without losing any details
